# Stock Analysis

## The Purpose of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the total daily volume of each stock company in the data. The Total daily volume represents the total number of shares traded throughout the day; this value will help the user to determine which stock company had the most number of shares traded throughout the day. Additionally the analysis was used to calculate the yearly return for each stock company, which shows the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year; the more positive the percentage is, the better the stock company was doing.

## Analysis

From the tables below when comparing the rate of return for 2017 and 2018, we can see that the stock companies in 2017 was doing a lot better compared to 2018 as there was only one stock company that had a decrease in yearly return in 2017 whereas more than half of the stock companies in 2018 had a decrease in yearly return. Additionally the execution time of the code informs us that 2017 had a shorter execution time.

## More About Refactoring Code
Refactoring code makes it easier to improve the code without changing the entirety of the codeâ€™s output. A disadvantage to this is that this may result in new bugs, which will be harder to see and fix. Refactoring the original VBA script made the alternation and editing of the new code easier, however it did make it harder to see and fix the bug as there were several time where the code only produced the total volume and return rates for the first stock company, AY only.
